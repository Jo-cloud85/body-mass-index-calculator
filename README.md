## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Expected behaviour

Below you will find the BMI ranges and their weight classifications. Based on the person's BMI results, add their weight classification onto sentence "Your BMI suggests youâ€™re" within the results component.

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI 30 or greater

Add the individual's healthy weight range based on the lower and upper BMI categorisations and the person's height.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt a few things about the radio buttons, on how to custom them and allow for 1 radio button to be checked (or multiple, depending on future contexts).

### Useful resources

- [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Custom radio buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_custom_radio) - I learn how to create simple custom radio buttons.
- [Only one radio button to be checked](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5419459/how-to-allow-only-one-radio-button-to-be-checked) - I learnt that to allow only one radio button to be checked, the radio buttons have to have the same name, and vice versa.
